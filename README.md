# MNIST-dataset
Implement different classification methods on Mnist dataset. The mnist dataset contains different hand-written numbers. In this project, the main purpose is detecting the numbers. We create the model based on different classification algorithms like Adaboost, CNN, Decision tree, Random forest, and SVM.
